-- STEP 8 : VIEWS
-- A view is a stored query. It stores no data of its own; each time it
-- is queried, Oracle runs the underlying SELECT on the base tables.
-- All five views below contain joins/aggregates, so they are read-only
-- (not updatable) — that is fine, they are for reporting.
-- =====================================================================


-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- VIEW 1: MOVIE_RATING_SUMMARY
-- Purpose: the "movie page" numbers — how many reviews and the average
-- rating — without repeating the LEFT JOIN + GROUP BY in every query.
-- Also shows why we do NOT store avg_rating in MOVIE: it is derived and
-- would go stale every time a review is added (update anomaly).
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW movie_rating_summary AS
SELECT m.movie_id,
       m.title,
       m.movie_language,

       ROUND(AVG(r.rating), 2) AS avg_rating
FROM   movie m
LEFT   JOIN review r ON r.movie_id = m.movie_id
GROUP  BY m.movie_id, m.title, m.movie_language;


-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- VIEW 2: MOVIE_DETAILS
-- Purpose: one row per movie with its genres and cast as readable text.
-- The M:N tables are normalized (one row per genre/actor); this view
-- "de-normalizes" them for display only, using LISTAGG.
-- Scalar subqueries are used instead of joining both M:N tables at once:
-- joining MOVIE_GENRE and MOVIE_ACTOR together would multiply rows
-- (3 genres x 3 actors = 9 rows per movie).

-- VIEW 4: BOOKING_SUMMARY
